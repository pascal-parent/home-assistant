# Home Assistant Docker Compose Scripts

## Warning!

This example code is supplied **"as is"** with no warranties of any kind, it works on my setup but it does not mean it will work on yours without modifications or at all. This example is meant to point you in the right direction. I take no responsibilities on it's usage. 
I've tried to document it sufficiently that it is readable and easy to understand.
